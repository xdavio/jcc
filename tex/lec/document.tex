\section*{Pvalue Calculatios based on the form of $\ha$}

Here, I provide three forms of the alternative hypothesis, the corresponding rejection region, and the corresponding pvalue calculation. Note that in the following $z$ is the observed value of the test statistic. 

\begin{enumerate}
  \item $\ha: \mu < \mun$: In this case, the critical value is $\zc$, and the rejection region is
\[
z < -\zc.
\]
\begin{framed}
The pvalue calculation is $P(Z < z)$.
\end{framed}

  \item $\ha: \mu \neq \mun$: In this case, the critical value is $\zctwo$, and the rejection region is
\[
z > \zctwo \qquad \text{or} \qquad z < - \zctwo
\]
\begin{framed}
The pvalue calculation is $P(Z < -|z|) + P(Z > |z|)$.
\end{framed}

  \item $\ha: \mu > \mun$: In this case, the critical value is $\zc$, and the rejection region is
\[
z > \zc
\]
\begin{framed}
The pvalue calculation is $P(Z > z)$.
\end{framed}
\end{enumerate}

I recommend drawing pictures of areas under the standard normal curve to match up with the pvalue calculations. The pvalue calculations for the $t$-test are analagous. 

\section*{Power Calculation}

Suppose that $\sigma$ is known, the data are normal, $\ho: \mu = \mun$, $\ha: \mu > \mun$, and we know $\mu = \mu_A$. We can then calculate the power.
\[
power = P \left ( Z > z_{\alpha} + \frac{\mun - \mu_A}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}} \right ) 
\]
Alternatively, if $\ha: \mu < \mun$
\[
power = P \left ( Z < -z_{\alpha} + \frac{\mun - \mu_A}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}} \right ) 
\]
For the purposes of this course, we'll ignore the case where $\ha: \mu \neq \mun$


\section*{Sample Size Calculation for Power}
Let $\ho: \mu = \mun$ and $\ha : \mu \neq \mun$. Suppose we know that $\mu = \mu_A$. Then for normal data with known $\sigma$, we can find the sample size to guarantee power = $1 - \beta$:
\begin{framed}
\[
n = \left ( \frac{\sigma (z_{\beta} + z_{\alpha / 2})}{\mun - \mu_A} \right ) ^2
\]
\end{framed}
Remember to round $n$ up to the nearest whole integer. If the form of $\ha$ is $<$ or $>$, then use $\alpha$ instead of $\alpha / 2$ in the formula.

\section*{Estimating the pvalue of the $t$-test using the $t$-table}

We did an extensive example in class about how to do this kind of calculation. Next week, in discussion, a similar calculation will occur.
